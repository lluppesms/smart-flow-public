Your goal is to:

   - The EPA registration
   - The topic being reviewed (e.g., naming, ingredients, precautionary statements, storage and disposal instructions, etc.)

2. **Task**:  
   - Identify all relevant conditions within the EPA registration that apply to the label based on the provided topic.  
   - Provide a concise statement or excerpt of each condition as written in the EPA registration.
   - Focus only on the sections related to topic.

3. **Output**:  
   - Return a structured list (e.g., bullet points) of each condition.  
   - For each entry, include:  
     - A title for the condition
     - A list of rules or requirements that must be met
